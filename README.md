# Stopwatch Project
## Overview
Stopwatch is an embedded systems project. It is coded on **ATMEGA16** MCU using **C-language** and the simulation is done on **Proteus**. Peripherals used are **GPIO** and **TIMERs**.
This projects apply the concept of **interrupts** with timers and external input.
## Hardware Used
 - AVR ATMEGA16 MCU
 - 7447 Decoder
 - 7SEG-MPX6-CA (7-segmentss with a multiplexer)
 - Resistors
 - 3 Push Buttons (Pause, Reset, Resume)
